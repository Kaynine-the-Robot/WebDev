# WebDev
A Repo for my collection of Web Development Projects

So Far I Have Made:
- Pokemon Generator: A project using JavaScript, HTMl, and a little CSS to generate a random pokemon with a description and picture. Uses the pokemon db api for data.
- Movie Browser app made in React. This small app is connected to a movie database through an API and will allow the user to search for movies and it will display their details. My repo for hosting this project is called movie-browser but the files I changed/created for the project are stored here under Movie Browser. Make sure to check out the hosted app at https://Kaynine-the-Robot.github.io/movie-browser !
- An older school project for a Web Chat Room using JavaScript mainly, with a little HTML and CSS. You can download the project and navigate to the main folder with server.js in it, run 'npm start' and then join in the chat room from a browser using localhost:3000.
