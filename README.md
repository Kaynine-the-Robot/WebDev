# WebDev
A Repo for my collection of Web Development Projects

So Far I Have Made:
- Pokemon Generator: A project using JavaScript, HTMl, and a little CSS to generate a random pokemon with a description and picture. Uses the pokemon db api for data.
- Movie Browser app made in React. This small app is connected to a movie database through an API and will allow the user to search for movies and it will display their details. My repo for this project is in movie-browser but you can check out the hosted app at https://Kaynine-the-Robot.github.io/movie-browser
